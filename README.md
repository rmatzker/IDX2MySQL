IDX2MySQL is a PERL script I wrote to import MLS data (real estate listings) from raw IDX dictionary and data files into a MySQL database.

Input consists of a paths to the dictionary and data files as well as the table name you would like to use.  Each IDX file is placed into it's own MySQL table as well as an overall index table used to quickly locate listings based on common search parameters.
